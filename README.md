# Dataspace Connector
Dataspace Connector for integration of Data Platform to dataspace


## Background

[Applied Research Platform for Autonomous Systems (ARPA)](https://arpa-project.turkuamk.fi/)-project consisted of multiple
work packages, one of these packages was the development of Data Platform. 

The Data Platform was developed to function as data acquisition, storage and processing platform 
for the needs of autonomous systems development and management.

To integrate the Data Platform to dataspaces, dataspace connector was developed to 
enable the integration of the Data Platform by using standardized communication between the created connector
and other participants of the dataspace hosting their own dataspace connectors.

The connector has been created with an aim to be compatible with [GaiaX](https://gaia-x.eu/) standards.

## About this repository

This repository contains a dataspace connector implementation created by utilizing Eclipse EDC.
The created connector has the functionalities to act as dataspace gateway for accessing data from the Data Platform of Wireless Communications and Cybersecyrity -research group of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
This repository may benefit actors wishing to develop their own dataspace connector by providing an example of Eclipse EDC usage.
